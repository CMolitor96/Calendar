# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
# Calendar

This is a simple daily calendar to keep track of events. There is a time block for each hour of a standard business day and a text area to write notes. The background of each time block signifies whether it is in the past, present, or future, with red, yellow, and green representing each categorization respectively. Once notes have been entered and the save button clicked, the notes will be stored in local storage and will persist on page reloads.
